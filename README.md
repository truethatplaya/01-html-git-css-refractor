# Title: hw-01 - Horiseon Website

## Description: Homework from UCD "01-HTML-Git-CSS" (2021)

In this homework assignement index.html and style.css was reviewed and refactored. The webpage was review and tested for functionality and accessibility.

What problem does it solve: the index.html code was refractored to specify the semantics, header, section, article, footer. Images were given "alt" tags to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
