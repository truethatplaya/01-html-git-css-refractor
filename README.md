# Title: hw-01

## Description: Homework from UCD "01-HTML-Git-CSS" (2021)

In this homework assignement I was tasked with reviewwing the index.html and style.css for functionality and accsesibility. I refactored, improved without changing the code. I reviewed, tested, and confirmed accessibility standards were met.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
